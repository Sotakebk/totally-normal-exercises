# 2D square grid pathfinding

#### With multiple algorithms.

In C++. __USES WINDOWS.H FOR CONSOLE FUNCTIONS!__

I Don't even know C++.

The only mildly interesting thing here is how the greedy depth-first algorithm uses the direction vector to consider the neighbour cells that are closer to the target first. Not using sorting for that because it would be silly.
